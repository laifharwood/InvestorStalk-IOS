This is an IOS Swift app that I made for Southern Utah Code Camp.  I didn't get much done on this during the 24 hour period since I spent most of the time on the back end writing this script: https://bitbucket.org/laifharwood/investorstalk-scraper.

The idea behind this app is to allow users to follow the investments of Billionaires by tracking what are called "Beneficial Ownership" SEC filings.

I mostly just have one Table View and a Tab bar controller setup just so I had something to show the judges.
